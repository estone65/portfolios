<strong>Aims of this document</strong>
</center>

<br>

Throughout her modules, Mason delves into detail on a number of different elements, explaining their different uses and how they can be useful to you. Similarly, when discussing how to do different tasks, she will often provide different ways that aim can be accomplished. This approach is very reasonable and is the one I would take – it provides training that goes above and beyond the specifics for this individual class. Other web-based videos take this approach too.

One limitation of this approach, however, is it can be challenging to accomplish fairly straightforward tasks, especially at the beginning of the semester, with all of the information that is provided. Thus I put together (for myself) this list of how to accomplish certain tasks, with a particular emphasis on those related to Git / Github, though with a brief description of some R studio tasks as well. This does not delve into the ‘why’s (e.g., it doesn’t discuss the difference between Git and Github) and is intended as a companion to what is already provided in Mason’s modules, as a brief reference guide. I’m making this publicly available in case it’s helpful to others. It is intended to be a ‘living document,’ to be updated to include more up-to-date information, other useful tips, etc.

As a secondary aim, in some cases I have also provided descriptions of how this approach differs from what was seen in my graduate class using SPSS. 

This document assumes that you have already: (1) installed R and R studio, (2) set up a Github account, and (3) installed Github Desktop.

<strong>How do I find the files for a particular lab?</strong>

All the relevant files are stored in Github, in a “repository” associated with that lab. Mason’s Github account is: https://github.com/DataScience4Psych (not to be confused with https://datascience4psych.github.io/DataScience4Psych/, as I did originally). Go to her Github account, and under repositories, search for the relevant one (e.g., by typing in lab 01). Then click on the relevant repository. 

Once you’ve done that, the relevant repository should show up. For example, for the first lab, it should direct you to https://github.com/DataScience4Psych/lab-01-hello-r . This contains all the relevant files for the first lab. It looks like:

<img src="p01/lab 1 repository.PNG" alt="Lab 1 Repository" width="700"/>

<strong>How do I get the relevant files on my computer?</strong>

You need to get the relevant files both on your computer, and on your personal Github account. Thankfully, there’s a way to do all of that in two steps. The basic idea is you’re going to just copy (‘clone’) everything from Mason’s account onto yours.  

First you will get her files onto your Github account. To do that, access the relevant repository from her Github account and:

1. Click <strong> Use this template -> create a new repository </strong>
2. This will take you to a page where you will need to specify the owner (should be filled in already – this is you), and a name for the lab that you’ll fill in (e.g., lab 1).
3. You can click public or private (Mason’s module explains the difference).
4. Click <strong> Create Repository </strong>

This will then create a copy (clone) of Mason’s repository on your Github account. However, you still need to get the files onto Github Desktop and onto your personal computer. To do that, from your repository (that you just created):

1. Click <strong> Code -> Open with Github Desktop </strong>
2. This will produce a pop-up with the address of your github, and the path on your computer. For example, for the 5th lab, mine looked like the following:

<img src="p01/getting files to your computer.PNG" alt="Getting Files to Your Computer" width="500"/>

3. Typically this should all be correct. In that case, just click <strong> Clone</strong>.

Notice that a folder with the relevant files has now been created on your computer, and you can access the folder from within Github Desktop.
